# About

This static website allows easy creation of phonology problem sets.

Instructions: (same as those on the website itself)

1. (Optional) Give the problem set a title and description.
2. Upload a dataset in CSV format.
3. (Optional) Upload a set of features in CSV format; if no feature set is uploaded, the default one displayed will be used. (The default feature set is taken from [Featurize!](http://www.phonology.us/featurize) by George Steel and Peter Jurgec, and other feature sets should follow the same pattern.)
4. Use the checkboxes to select which entries to include; you can choose to include or exclude specific entries, as well as those including specific phonemes or phonemes with specific features. Use < Tab > and < Alt-Tab > to walk through checkboxes.
5. Print using your browser's print functionality; only the title, description, and the data you choose to include will be printed. Your browser should allow you to print to PDF if you would like electronic copies. Entries will be automatically numbered.
6. Changes you make will be reflected immediately.
